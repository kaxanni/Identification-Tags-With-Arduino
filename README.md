# Identification-Tags-With-Arduino
This is an attendance system using arduino uno and rfid as the the main components 

you will need the following hardwares
-Arduino Uno
-Rfid tags
-RC522 rfid module
-LCD (preferrable i2c LCD)
-RTC module 
-wires
-Leds
-breadboard
-power supply

this project will make use of the rtc modules capability to capture live time to detect if the user (holders of rfid tags) are on time when clocking in or late. The system will also detect if the tag that is punched in is a registered tag or not. For configuring the hardware to the arduino there are plenty of tutorials and schematics on the internet on how to do that and make sure to download the necesarry library for each peripherals.
